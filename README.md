# Taxi_Price_Prediction_Hackathon


This hackathon will try to address the challenges faced by taxi operators in quoting the right fare to customers before starting the trip. However, the details are shared with taxi drivers or operators related to the trip, they find it difficult to quote the right fare because of uncertainties and calculation complexities. The same issue is faced by passengers as well because of inaccurate or irrelevant fares quoted. To find a solution for this, this hackathon provides a historical dataset to participants that includes records of taxi trip details and fares of those trips. Using this dataset,build machine learning models for predicting the trip fare based on the given other useful features of the trip.
